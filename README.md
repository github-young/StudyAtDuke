These are my study files at Duke University: ECE, EM, QM and STAT.

*For students major in physics in NJU, they need to attend __ECE230L__(Micro Devices &Circuits), __PHY342D__(EM), and __PHY464__(QM), while the __STA250__(Mathematical Statistics) is a course chosen out of interest, which means you can choose any other one-credit courses you like.*

It was used to synchronize the files between multiple platforms.

Since the program is over, these files will not be updated any more. Goodbye Duke.
